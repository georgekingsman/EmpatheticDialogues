you love them more than their therapist but you simply lack the education and training necessary to deal with their problem.you would never think of performing surgery on a loved one, not because you dont love them sufficiently but because you simply lack the ability and experience of a surgeon. its obvious to most people that without the skill and knowledge of a surgeon it would be foolish and perhaps deadly to perform surgery on someone you love.without the many years of education and experience, it would be just as foolish to attempt to do counseling with someone you love. i often tell my clients, who are experiencing the thoughts and feelings that you have right now, that it is far better to feel that perhaps you did not do enough than to know that your words and attempts to help a loved one actually resulted in their suicide. yes, it is possible to make a mistake during surgery that will result in someones death  and it is equally possible to make a mistake in therapy that will result in someones suicide.every surgeon does his best and every therapist does likewise. i think it is best to realize our limitations. we have a limit as to our skills in any particular area. no matter how much we love someone and want to help them, our skill limits are not increased.when i have a client ask me about a friend of theirs or family member who is having a mental problem and what they can do for them, i always tell them to encourage them to go into therapy. if you have read this column you have read many letters from readers who talk about the immense difficulty they are having trying to get a mother, father, son, etc., into therapy. my response to them is to acknowledge that often no amount of effort on their part is enough to achieve their desired result.the question for you is did you do enough?

be very abusive towards me mostly mentally abusive, but sometimes physically abusive, e.g. throwing a chair at me. he is in therapy right now and is working on those problems. the reason i came to this website was that he mentioned to me today that his therapist said that the jealousy is all on me, that i am to either be with him or not. she said that if i choose to be with him, i should trust him. point blank. this concerned me, because my boyfriend is always trying to find a way to blame me for his problems and such. i didnt think this was a fair accusation. he is constantly lying to me and doing things to break my trust. i want to be with him, but its hard to trust him. i am always completely honest with him, and i dont think its unreasonable to expect the same in return. but am i all to blame for the jealousy and trust issues that i have within this relationship?", "response": "i think it is very important that you recognize this is a problem and work with your boyfriend to

things that he is not is concerning. you need to get yourself to the bottom of this, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions. you need to make sure that he gets help and get to the bottom

desiring to hurt others is not normal. most people dont feel that way. its good that you recognize these feelings as being problematic. solving a problem first requires acknowledgment. it is an important first step.its also worrisome that you have tried to hurt animals. not only is it morally wrong, but its illegal. if caught, you could be charged with a serious crime. the federal government has recently increased the penalties for people convicted of hurting animals. the federal bureau of investigation fbi considers animal abuse a crime against society. it is often a precursor to serious criminal behavior. people who hurt animals might also hurt people.some communities have created a registry of animal abusers. much like sex offender registries, people convicted of hurting animals are placed on the registry and barred from owning animals. these registries are publicly accessible so that community members can keep their animals away from dangerous people.in order to protect yourself against future legal trouble, i would strongly advise that you consult a mental health professional. ask your parents to help you find a therapist. a clinical evaluation will determine if something is wrong. most importantly, the therapist will then create a treatment plan to address your problematic behavior.finally, if you feel that you are a danger to yourself or to others, call the authorities. they can protect you from doing something that you would regret. hurting people and animals could lead to your arrest and severe punishment. treatment could help you immensely. it has the potential to positively alter your course in life. please take care.", "model": "gpt2-finetuned-baseline", "checkpoint": "checkpoints/baseline_best.pt", "seed": 42, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 0.9, "top_k": 50,

it may be a good idea to sit down with your friend and both sets of parents and express your love and concern and see how you and your parents can support your friend. another possible resource is childhelp national hotline. you can tell them about your concerns with your friend and they will identify resources in your area.if your friends parents are fully aware that their daughter is cutting and in need of psychological intervention and they refuse to get their daughter the treatment she needs, then this may be a case of medical neglect requiring or your parents to report the situation to child protective services. i hope it doesnt come to that. thank you again for writing in to ask the therapist.take good care of yourself.julie hanks, lcsw", "model": "gpt2-finetuned-baseline", "checkpoint": "checkpoints/baseline_best.pt", "seed": 42, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 0.9, "top_k": 50, "max_new_tokens": 128, "do_sample": true, "runtime_s": 8.214, "ts": "2026-02-17T14:21:18.702468+00:00"}

that you arent interested in sex. its not his fault that you arent interested in sex. its not your fault that you have sexual fantasies about this kind of thing. it is not your fault that you cant stop fantasizing about it. its not your fault that you arent interested in sex", "reference": "there are many sexual fetishes that involve urine or urination. it is also very possible to feel guilt or anxiety about a sexual fetish. behaviorists would have one explanation for this phenomenon but other branches of psychology would have different explanations. psychoanalysts would also have varying explanations.the same area of the body that provides sexual pleasure also is used for urination and defecation. you can see how easily these two processes could be associated within the mind of a child. parents often make a strong point of telling a child that these areas of the body are dirty and when you touch yourself there you must wash their hands immediately. many of these children grow up to feel that sexual activity is also dirty. any pleasure that comes from a dirty thing is something that they feel is wrong and as such should produce guilt, they should feel guilty about wanting and liking something that is so dirty.sexual fetishes could also be easily explained by early association. behaviorists believe that phobias are the result of unintended pairings of unconditioned stimuli with conditioned stimuli. for example the child cuts his finger, he is bleeding, the child has no reaction to the blood. the blood is a neutral stimulus to the child, meaning he has no reaction to the blood. however, the mother screams. the scream of fear of the mother is the unconditioned stimulus, which produces the unconditioned response which is fear and crying, within the childs mind. the child sees the blood and associates blood with the unconditioned stimulus which is the mothers scream. through this one accidental pairing, blood or the sight of blood now has the power to produce the same unconditioned response as does the mothers scream. this associative learning can endure for a lifetime. as a result the child and in the future the adult, will feel terror at the sight of or thought of blood. in a similar fashion, if a child accidentally feels sexual stimulation while perceiving urine he could later associate urine or urination with feelings of sexuality.many therapists who do dream interpretation, would interpret a dream about a bathroom or going to a bathroom in a public place, as a sexual dream.many women report female ejaculation and have for many years. many researchers deny the possibility of female ejaculation but new research has shown that it may be real. some researchers believe that female ejaculation is really urination but others believe it is not. recent studies suggest that it is not urine at all but rather a substance that contains many of the same chemicals found in ejaculate. scientists believe that female ejaculation occurs most frequently with gspot stimulated orgasms. you are presently seeing a urologist. if there is any anatomical irregularity, i am sure that your urologist will discover this. there may not be any irregularity anatomically or otherwise.in my mind the biggest problem is the guilt that you feel and also the anxiety. you mention in your letter, that you have not had an orgasm in three years and the event that has prevented you from orgasming in three years, was a small amount of urination at the time of your last orgasm. in my ideal world, i would want you to feel no unwarranted guilt, to have no anxiety, and to have a healthy, normal, pleasurable sex life. notice, that i had no concern for the small amount of urine that is present at the time of your orgasm. the only concern i have about this is the fact that it produces for you anxiety and guilt.i would highly recommend that you see a competent therapist, perhaps sex therapist, counselor etc. they could quite easily help you with the issues that weve been discussing. id like to close this answer by telling you a story that i well remember from one of my early psychology classes. the professor told us about something that freud had written. he said that freud had received many letters from the mother of a homosexual man and that the mother had promised freud a large amount of money, if he freud would help her child to no longer be homosexual. the mother told freud how grateful she would be if he helped her son. she told him how worried she was, how she could not sleep at night and the great anxiety that she felt in her every waking moments. my professor went on to say that freud wrote back to the woman and told her that he could very well understand the problem. he told the woman that he would be happy to schedule her for regular appointments because she was the one who had the problem and the problem was her anxiety and not the homosexual activity of her son. freud told her he did not believe that the son had the problem but that she did.i hope that you will take my advice and make an appointment with a competent therapist. you should not be living in fear or anxiety. you should be having an anxiety free sex life, with all the pleasure it can provide. if you have any questions please write back. i wish you the very best.", "model": "gpt2-finetuned-baseline",
