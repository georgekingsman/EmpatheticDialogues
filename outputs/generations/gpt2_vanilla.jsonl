be very abusive towards me mostly mentally abusive, but sometimes physically abusive, e.g. throwing a chair at me. he is in therapy right now and is working on those problems. the reason i came to this website was that he mentioned to me today that his therapist said that the jealousy is all on me, that i am to either be with him or not. she said that if i choose to be with him, i should trust him. point blank. this concerned me, because my boyfriend is always trying to find a way to blame me for his problems and such. i didnt think this was a fair accusation. he is constantly lying to me and doing things to break my trust. i want to be with him, but its hard to trust him. i am always completely honest with him, and i dont think its unreasonable to expect the same in return. but am i all to blame for the jealousy and trust issues that i have within this relationship?", "response": "i'm a very open person, and am very open about my feelings. i have been very open with my therapist

you already started by writing your letter to us here at psychcentral.i do have to wonder how are you managing to support yourself living as you do? either you are independently wealthy or someone is enabling you. if the latter is the case, you are not as socially isolated as you think. it looks to me like your mother hasnt given up on you if you continue to have a roof over your head and something to eat  or not eat. my guess is that your parents dont know what to do but hope and hope that you will snap out of this if they just climb into your discouragement with you and leave you alone. that approach avoids fights but it does leave you alone and lonely.for that reason, i see this as a family case. you need help out of your depressed rut. your family needs help finding a way to love you and help you without enabling your depression and dependency.at 18, its time for you to get going on adult life. my guess is that you are paralyzed by fear of what that entails. when people are afraid they generally respond with a fight, flight, or freeze reaction. in your case, you are fleeing by freezing. you have allowed yourself to think that if you do nothing, you cant make a mistake. in some ways it works but the strategy has turned on itself. now, not doing anything is the mistake. its taken on a life of its own. you are depressed and your life is depressing.you need help facing your fears. you need support to rejoin the social world and to become the fully functioning adult you can be. that means dealing with your sleep disorder. that means engaging in your hobbies for real. there are millions of kids who enjoy larping in the woods and then hanging out. you could be enjoying their company. that means taking steps to become independent  which means dealing with your social anxiety and either going to school or going to work or both. none of this is news to you. but maybe i can give you an idea or two about how to approach ityour selfesteem will not improve if you hide in your bedroom. it will improve if you start being a contributing member of your family. if you wait until you feel good to do anything, chances are you will remain stuck. feeling good comes from doing things that are worthwhile. a place to start would be to set your alarm for the morning, get up and take a shower, then do something, anything, that is lifeaffirming, even something as mundane but important as doing your laundry. you can build from there.your family needs help to stop feeling so helpless to help you. they need new tools to support you in dealing with your depression instead of leaving you alone. you didnt choose to share your relationship with your father. if it is a good one, he may be at a distance but he can still be helpful, both to you and to your mother, through video calls and emails. he just may need some guidance about how best to help.its a tall order for anyone  and any family  to make such a significant change. thats why i think its a team effort. you and your family need the support and practical help that a mental health professional can provide. i hope you will talk to your mother about finding a licensed family therapist to get the advice and support you all need and deserve.if it has become too hard to talk to her directly, please show this letter to your mother. i suspect she is discouraged and scared. maybe hearing what i have to say will give her some direction in how to help both of you.i wish you well.", "model": "gpt2-vanilla", "checkpoint": "pretrained", "seed": 42, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 0.9, "top_k": 50, "max_new_tokens": 128, "do_sample": true, "runtime_s": 5.939, "ts": "2026-02-17T12:21:32.788705+00:00"}

for this phenomenon but other branches of psychology would have different explanations. psychoanalysts would also have varying explanations.the same area of the body that provides sexual pleasure also is used for urination and defecation. you can see how easily these two processes could be associated within the mind of a child. parents often make a strong point of telling a child that these areas of the body are dirty and when you touch yourself there you must wash their hands immediately. many of these children grow up to feel that sexual activity is also dirty. any pleasure that comes from a dirty thing is something that they feel is wrong and as such should produce guilt, they should feel guilty about wanting and liking something that is so dirty.sexual fetishes could also be easily explained by early association. behaviorists believe that phobias are the result of unintended pairings of unconditioned stimuli with conditioned stimuli. for example the child cuts his finger, he is bleeding, the child has no reaction to the blood. the blood is a neutral stimulus to the child, meaning he has no reaction to the blood. however, the mother screams. the scream of fear of the mother is the unconditioned stimulus, which produces the unconditioned response which is fear and crying, within the childs mind. the child sees the blood and associates blood with the unconditioned stimulus which is the mothers scream. through this one accidental pairing, blood or the sight of blood now has the power to produce the same unconditioned response as does the mothers scream. this associative learning can endure for a lifetime. as a result the child and in the future the adult, will feel terror at the sight of or thought of blood. in a similar fashion, if a child accidentally feels sexual stimulation while perceiving urine he could later associate urine or urination with feelings of sexuality.many therapists who do dream interpretation, would interpret a dream about a bathroom or going to a bathroom in a public place, as a sexual dream.many women report female ejaculation and have for many years. many researchers deny the possibility of female ejaculation but new research has shown that it may be real. some researchers believe that female ejaculation is really urination but others believe it is not. recent studies suggest that it is not urine at all but rather a substance that contains many of the same chemicals found in ejaculate. scientists believe that female ejaculation occurs most frequently with gspot stimulated orgasms. you are presently seeing a urologist. if there is any anatomical irregularity, i am sure that your urologist will discover this. there may not be any irregularity anatomically or otherwise.in my mind the biggest problem is the guilt that you feel and also the anxiety. you mention in your letter, that you have not had an orgasm in three years and the event that has prevented you from orgasming in three years, was a small amount of urination at the time of your last orgasm. in my ideal world, i would want you to feel no unwarranted guilt, to have no anxiety, and to have a healthy, normal, pleasurable sex life. notice, that i had no concern for the small amount of urine that is present at the time of your orgasm. the only concern i have about this is the fact that it produces for you anxiety and guilt.i would highly recommend that you see a competent therapist, perhaps sex therapist, counselor etc. they could quite easily help you with the issues that weve been discussing. id like to close this answer by telling you a story that i well remember from one of my early psychology classes. the professor told us about something that freud had written. he said that freud had received many letters from the mother of a homosexual man and that the mother had promised freud a large amount of money, if he freud would help her child to no longer be homosexual. the mother told freud how grateful she would be if he helped her son. she told him how worried she was, how she could not sleep at night and the great anxiety that she felt in her every waking moments. my professor went on to say that freud wrote back to the woman and told her that he could very well understand the problem. he told the woman that he would be happy to schedule her for regular appointments because she was the one who had the problem and the problem was her anxiety and not the homosexual activity of her son. freud told her he did not believe that the son had the problem but that she did.i hope that you will take my advice and make an appointment with a competent therapist. you should not be living in fear or anxiety. you should be having an anxiety free sex life, with all the pleasure it can provide. if you have any questions please write back. i wish you the very best.", "model": "gpt2-vanilla", "checkpoint": "pretrained", "seed": 42, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 0.9, "top_k": 50, "max_new_tokens": 128, "do_sample": true, "runtime_s": 6.144,

whether you can determine the difference between reality and nonreality. my question to you would be do you believe that your irrational thoughts are true?if you believe that your mother might actually harm you and there is no basis for this belief i.e. she never threatened to harm you, shes never harmed anyone, theres no reason to believe that she may harm you, and so forth, this would be considered a paranoid ideation or a delusion.if you believed that people around you were on something and because of this belief you no longer associated with them, despite evidence to the contrary, then i would be concerned about the possible development of a psychosisbased disorder.having irrational thoughts does not necessarily indicate psychosis or schizophrenia. the real concern is if you believe that your thoughts are true despite there being no proof, no evidence to support your beliefs or in the face of evidence to the contrary. by definition, a delusion is an erroneous belief held even when there is evidence to the contrary. delusions and paranoia are characteristics of psychoticbased disorders.you are correct to be concerned about these symptoms. unfortunately, i cannot definitively answer your question unless i am able to interview you in person. i believe you should be evaluated by a mental health professional. he or she can determine if your symptoms are related to panic disorder or they are indicative of a possible psychotic disorder.it is also important to note that you wrote a very logical and wellprepared letter. this shows that you are thinking clearly. thought disorganization is a sign of schizophrenia and other psychoticbased disorders. theres no evidence in this letter of that particular symptom. also encouraging is the fact that you are very selfaware of your symptoms. selfawareness is often an essential ingredient in the successful treatment of mental health disorders.one final thought, you mentioned that you have utilized a specific form of yoga to help decrease your panic symptoms. it is very good that you are utilizing yoga to decrease your symptoms. i would encourage you to continue yoga classes but i would also recommend medication and psychotherapy. medication and counseling, in addition to yoga, could be a very efficient way to cure the symptoms that are degrading your life.if you choose to explore medication as a form of treatment, it is recommended that you see a psychiatrist. primary care physicians can and do prescribe their patients psychotropic medications. many are very good and highly qualified but a psychiatrist has years of additional training in the field of mental health treatments and disorders.psychology today has a listing of mental health professionals. by typing in your zip code, you may be able to find one in your community.without treatment, your symptoms may become worse. with treatment, the quality of your life can be significantly improved. do not let fear and anxiety continue to degrade your life. i hope that you will consider professional mental health treatment. it can benefit you but only if you are willing to try. thank you for your question.", "model": "gpt2-vanilla", "checkpoint": "pretrained", "seed": 42, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 0.9, "top_k": 50, "max_new_tokens": 128, "do_sample": true, "runtime_s": 6.425, "ts": "2026-02-17T12:21:32.788705+00:00"}
