eval_0003,"what do you do when you have been unable to have any hope for your own future? this has gone on for 6 years. i can still find joy, but i have lost almost everything. the mental healthcare system is appalling, its about cheap imported toxic drugs used to chemically neuter anyone who is passionate or who is white, straight, and conservative. and i am sick of being lumped in with opioid addicts. addicts made a choice to abuse drugs. depression, ptsd, are not a choice. plus i am sick of illegals, minorities,  special interests getting to do and say what ever they want, and of them getting a free ride while i work my butt off only to have what i earn taken from me  given to those freeloaders. obamacare has allowed our private medical data to be expolited for profit see the fico medication adherence score for example. i have corporate health insurance but it now costs 10,000 out of pocket per year  only covers the same crappy providers that medicaid welfare freeloaders can access. the toxic left and congress destroyed us healthcare via obama. now the cures act ensures humans are the medical device guinea pigs instead of the former fda 2animal modelclinical trial model. grneric meds are literally toxic and inferior worh side effect profiles that are horrific  cheap meds are useless. moreover, the quality of the fake providers nonmds that is the new standard in the valuebased hellcare industry is nothing but a sick joke. this is why i dont want to wake up tomorrow where is the hope for any quality of life in the future? this is america. and as the former spouse of a legal immigrant, where is this nation headed when citizens are treated like trash?","thank you for writing in with your question. youve made the right choice to speak to your parents about these issues and i think you are in a good place to begin. now i would strongly encourage you to talk to your parents about these issues. it is not uncommon for parents to talk to their children about these issues, but the fact that they are aware of these issues and are doing so is a very good sign. your parents should also be aware of the potential negative effects of these drugs on you.as you noted, you are only 21 and have been to college. you will be able to access the same services as other college"

eval_0006,"3 weeks ago, i went to my very first psychiatrist appointment. it was a pretty big milestone for me as i havent been in contact with any mental health professional since i was 15, and i was really looking forward to finally getting the help i need. the whole experience was dissatisfactory overall, from filling out forms in the waiting room, to waiting for the doctor to actually come in for hours, i had switched from anxious but hopeful to frustrated and wishing i could just get it over with. eventually, she the psychiatrist called me in and we talked for no more than 5 minutes. she asked me many questions but by the end she was completely dismissive about everything i confided in her about and ushered me out the door saying i am a psychiatrist, i deal with people who have real problems, which you do not have, just bad coping skills. ah, yes, bad coping skills. i left with only one question in my mind if i dont have any problems, what do you think those bad coping skills come from? to say i was upset upon my arrival at home would be a massive understatement. it took everything within me to not express my rage. i wanted to scream, i wanted to cut, i wanted to burn my entire house down even if it meant death to my whole family just so i could die in it  but thats not me. i hate bringing others into my personal problems. and so, i crashed into an extreme depressive episode in which i spent the evening crying for 7 hours, didnt get out of bed for days, didnt eat for more than a week im only recently starting to eat at least one meal a day and spent every waking moment feeling like i need to jump off a bridge because even the thought of my own existence makes me feel incurably sick to the stomach and pained in the head. currently, im doing significantly better, and aim to contact a new therapist within the next week or so, but that initial experience is something i doubt ill ever forget, but honestly, i just wonder whats the purpose of it all, as my desire for escape from existence runs its course, even when im not in any way depressed at all. from the usa","3 weeks ago, i came back to my house and was still feeling bad. i was so excited for the day, i would have loved to have some time to just chill out and take a deep breath and think about what i would do, but it was so hard to do that. i got out of bed late and woke up to the sound of my own body pounding against my door. i started crying. i tried to say something, but i was so angry and scared that i was starting to feel like a complete fool for telling my friends that i was depressed and I was going to be in a coma for the rest of my"

eval_0324,"im 15. several months ago, after several suicide attempts, self harm, homicidal thoughts, bouts of rapid anger that led me to scream at people over nothing and once or twice to randomly start strangling and animal, stop and not even know why i did what i just did, panic attacks,mood swings and several other things, my parents decided to takd me to the doctor.i was diagnosed as bipolar and the doctor gave me a mood stabilizer.what didnt really make the depression or mood swings go away, it did help to stabalize my mood.next time i saw the psychiatrist, my parents told him that they had noticed not only changes in my mood but also changes in my personality. i now liked music and dance. i was more social and outgoing and talked more as well as changes in humor sense conversation style and several other changes in my personality. they thought the changes were good and they didnt notice any major changes. according to them, the aspects of my personality that had changed were all just symptoms of a disorder and the medicine fixed them, so that their going away was a sign that i was getting better and becoming who i really am. up until then, i had no idea i had changed. i didnt like the idea that i had changed because it means that im no longer the real me in my eyes. im who the medicine has made me and im now a different person than who i really am. those aspects of my personality were a part of what made me me and i hate that a medicine changed me without me even knowing. now to the actual question. i used to hear voices a lot. they told me to kill myself and others as well as other things, but they went away. recently, theyve come back so now, my doctor has given me risperidone, a medicine he says will make the voices go away and stay away. its worked and i have had a quiet brain for over a week, but im worried that the antipschotic he gave me will change my personality even more and ill endd up as another person who is completely different than myself. so, could antipschotics change me? will they? also, not the main question, but does the fact that im bipolar, hear voices, have homicidal thoughts, see troubling images, tried to strangle animals in a random moment and other stuff mean im crazy?","i am sorry you have been having these issues. i am concerned that you have been treated for the very serious problems with which you are struggling. i would recommend consulting your primary care physician for an evaluation and to determine what might be wrong.the diagnosis of bipolar disorder is complex and depends upon the nature of the disorder. in the vast majority of cases, it is not a mental health disorder but rather a combination of several mental health disorders. in rare instances, individuals with bipolar disorder are treated in the course of treatment. in addition, individuals with schizophrenia are treated in the course of treatment. these individuals have a history of psychotic disorders. these"

eval_0440,"from the u.s. 2 years ago my wife walked away from my son and i. she said she didnt know who she was or what she wanted. she after a few months realized she made a mistake and said she was coming back home. things were ok. we were sexually active with each other. during this time she was living with the boyfriend. she was ready to come back and now i found out that there is a 3rd guy in the mix, and she is once again saying she doesnt know who she is or what she wants. she seems to be all about herself and not her family. very selfish. she claims we are on different paths in life yet she says she hates what she is doing but she continues to do it and thinks its ok.",i am sorry that this has happened to you. but what i cant do is make her feel guilty for her behavior. the fact that she is blaming you isnt likely to change the dynamic. you didnt mention if she has ever hurt anyone. you didnt mention if she has ever threatened or hurt someone. the answer is no. it doesnt matter what she says. you are right that she is hurt. its not okay.its also not her fault. you are right that she is upset and angry. she has never given you the respect and love you deserve. thats not your fault. its her fault.i wish you well.
